# MovieBook

Implementation of an AngularJS app which displays movie info (currently for the Terminator collection).

# Setup

*MovieBook can be run locally without a server, but does require internet access to download AngularJS via a CDN.*

1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Add `secrets.js` file to the app's root directory
	
	```javascript
	// secrets.js
	var api_key = '[Your TMDB api_key]';
	```
3. Open `index.html`

# To do

~~1. Lazy load movie info~~
~~2. Add specs~~
~~3. Add loading spinners~~
4. Add collection search (expand beyond Terminator)
